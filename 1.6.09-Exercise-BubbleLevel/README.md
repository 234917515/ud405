# Bubble Level

In this demo you'll use accelerometer readings to create a bubble level, like the kind you use in carpentry to make sure a board is flat.

This exercise is very similar to the previous demo, where we drew lines representing the magnitude of the acceleration in the direction of the various axes. In this case, however, we'll combine those magnitudes into a single vector, and draw a "bubble" there.

To give some points of reference, we'll also draw a circle at 9.8m/s^2, to indicate when the phone is vertical, and a small circle that just encloses the "bubble" when the phone is flat.
