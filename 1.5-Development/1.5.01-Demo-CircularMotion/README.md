# Movement!

So far we've been drawing static images that don't move, but that's clearly not enough to make a game. In this level we'll learn the various ways to keep track of time. We'll also learn more about LibGDX game architecture, and how we can get LibGDX to handle some timekeeping for us. 

Finally, we'll learn to fake some very basic physics, so we can make objects move in a realistic way.
