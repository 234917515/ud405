# Accelerometer Movement

In this exercise, we'll allow the user to move the ball simply by tilting their phone! 

We'll use the exiting ACCELERATION constant to determine how fast to move the ball. We've also introduced an ACCELEROMETER_SENSITIVITY constant to determine how much tilt is required to get the full acceleration. To determine the acceleration


Check out the TODOs to get started.
